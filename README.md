### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a CS student from Russia who writes stuff time to time. Most of the projects in my Github are things which already existed but I wanted to write something of my own:

* [communism](https://github.com/keddad/communism) is a tool to control backlight on Intel-powered laptops. I wanted to try Rust, so it is written in Rust.

* [tgspellchecker](https://github.com/keddad/tgspellchecker) is, surprisingly, a spellchecker for Telegram. Written in JS, because I wanted to try JS, uses APIs from Yandex.

* [surveybot](https://github.com/keddad/surveybot) is a Telegram bot, for, well, surveys. Written in Python, very simple, supports export to .csv file and can process Audio/Video messages with some voice recognition.

I've also written some more unique things:

* [nametract](https://github.com/keddad/nametract) is a Python package for extraction of names from text. It doesn't use any kind of ML, so it is small and simple. Not very precise, but it worked for me. Published in pip: [nametract](https://pypi.org/project/nametract/).

* [torrentcrawler](https://github.com/keddad/torrentcrawler) is some Python code, written with Scrapy, to scrap torrents from rutracker.org.

* [weebie](https://github.com/keddad/weebie) is a Golang application which can pattern-match suspicious requests. I didn't create that, but I did write some code for this project.
