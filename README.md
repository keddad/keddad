### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a CS student from Russia who writes stuff time to time. For example:

* [tgspellchecker](https://github.com/keddad/tgspellchecker) is, surprisingly, a spellchecker for Telegram. Written in JS, because I wanted to try JS, uses APIs from Yandex.

* [thevyshka-reporter](https://github.com/keddad/thevyshka-reporter) is a Telegram bot for feedback. It is simular to bots Livegram generates.

* [nametract](https://github.com/keddad/nametract) is a Python package for extraction of names from text. It doesn't use any kind of ML, so it is small and simple. Not very precise, but it worked for me. Published in pip: [nametract](https://pypi.org/project/nametract/).

* [torrentcrawler](https://github.com/keddad/torrentcrawler) is some Python code, written with Scrapy, to scrap torrents from rutracker.org.
